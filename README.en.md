> 🎯 An AI-powered skill mapping and career coaching tool for early-career web engineers.

Paste in your skills and work experience (in Japanese) and get **skill radar charts, learning roadmaps, job matching, interview practice, and portfolio summaries** — all stitched into a single, coherent flow.

- 🌐 **Live demo**: <https://ai-skill-map-generator.vercel.app>
- 📱 **PWA**: installable on Android / iOS home screen (Add to Home Screen)
- 🔐 **Auth**: email & password + Google Sign-In (Supabase Auth)
- 🌏 **i18n**: fully bilingual UI (Japanese / English) with locale-aware routing and metadata
- 📖 **Japanese README**: [README.md](./README.md)

### What this project says about me

- I design and ship **small, coherent products end‑to‑end**, not just isolated features or throwaway demos.
- I’m comfortable owning **product thinking, architecture, AI integration and DX/testing** by myself.
- I care about **how it feels to use** (onboarding, copy, i18n, error states) as much as *what* it does.

### Who is this for?

- **Early-career web engineers** preparing for their **first or next job change**

### Tech Stack

```
Frontend:   Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript 5.6
Backend:    Next.js Route Handlers + OpenAI SDK
Database:   Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth, RLS)
Validation: Zod
Testing:    Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)

Styling:    Tailwind CSS
CI/CD:      GitHub Actions
```

### Product & engineering depth

This project is intentionally built to look and feel like a **small real-world product**, not just a toy demo:

- **Authentication & Data Safety**
  - Supabase Auth with email/password + Google Sign-In
  - User-specific skill maps and interview sessions stored in Supabase with RLS (Row Level Security)
  - Clear separation between public demo behavior and logged-in user data

- **Testing & CI Pipeline**
  - Vitest unit tests for core logic (readiness scoring, answer evaluation, etc.)
  - Playwright E2E tests for the main flow (Home → Diagnose → Result)
  - GitHub Actions CI running both unit + E2E tests on pull requests
  - Test coverage and Playwright artifacts (screenshots / traces) uploaded as CI artifacts

- **Usage Logging & Simple Metrics**
  - Usage logs stored in the database for key events (diagnosis, interview practice, etc.)
  - `/admin/usage` dashboard to inspect:
    - Recent events list
    - Event names by feature (diagnosis, job match, 1on1 practice, etc.)
  - Designed as a starting point for data-driven product improvement

- **Internationalization & UX**
  - Fully bilingual UI (Japanese / English) with locale-aware routing and metadata
  - All major user flows (Home, Dashboard, Result, Portfolio, Auth, Legal) are translated
  - API error messages and client-side error handling use consistent error codes and i18n strings
  - Basic E2E coverage for language switching and translated content with Playwright

- **PWA & Mobile Experience**
  - Installable as a PWA on Android / iOS (Add to Home Screen)
  - Basic offline-friendly behavior via `manifest.json` and a simple `sw.js`
  - Mobile-first layout and touch-friendly controls

### If I joined your team, I would add value by…

- Designing and validating **vertical slices** end‑to‑end – from problem framing and UX flows to shipped features.
- Owning **AI‑powered experiences**: prompt design, failure modes, latency/cost trade‑offs and observability.
- Raising the bar on **DX and testability**: type‑first design, clear contracts between layers, and pragmatic E2E coverage where it matters.
